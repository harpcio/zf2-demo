(1, 'Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#', 'With the award-winning book Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices, Robert C. Martin helped bring Agile principles to tens of thousands of Java and C++ programmers. Now .NET programmers have a definitive guide to agile methods with this completely updated volume from Robert C. Martin and Micah Martin, Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#.\r\n\r\nThis book presents a series of case studies illustrating the fundamentals of Agile development and Agile design, and moves quickly from UML models to real C# code. The introductory chapters lay out the basics of the agile movement, while the later chapters show proven techniques in action. The book includes many source code examples that are also available for download from the authorsâ€™ Web site.', '978-83-246-1177-5', 2006, 'Prentice Hall', 47.36),
(2, 'Software Development', 'Even the best developers have seen well-intentioned software projects fail -- often because the customer kept changing requirements, and end users didn''t know how to use the software you developed. Instead of surrendering to these common problems, let Head First Software Development guide you through the best practices of software development. Before you know it, those failed projects will be a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nWith its unique visually rich format, this book pulls together the hard lessons learned by expert software developers over the years. You''ll gain essential information about each step of the software development lifecycle -- requirements, design, coding, testing, implementing, and maintenance -- and understand why and how different development processes work.', '978-83-246-1547-6', 2008, 'O''Reilly Media', 32.48),

But now you want more, you want to really dig into those databases and work with your data. Head First SQL will show you the fundamentals of SQL and how to really take advantage of it. We''ll take you on a journey through the language, from basic INSERT statements and SELECT queries to hardcore database manipulation with indices, joins, and transactions. We all know "Data is Power" - but we''ll show you how to have "Power over your Data".

(6, 'Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship', 'Even bad code can function. But if code isnâ€™t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesnâ€™t have to be that way.\r\n\r\nNoted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship . Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code â€œon the flyâ€ into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmerâ€”but only if you work at it.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of work will you be doing? Youâ€™ll be reading codeâ€”lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about whatâ€™s right about that code, and whatâ€™s wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.\r\n\r\nClean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up codeâ€”of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and â€œsmellsâ€ gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.', '000-01-323-5088-2', 2008, 'Prentice Hall', 38.85),
(7, 'Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code', 'Refactoring is about improving the design of existing code. It is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code, yet improves its internal structure. With refactoring you can even take a bad design and rework it into a good one. This book offers a thorough discussion of the principles of refactoring, including where to spot opportunities for refactoring, and how to set up the required tests. There is also a catalog of more than 40 proven refactorings with details as to when and why to use the refactoring, step by step instructions for implementing it, and an example illustrating how it works The book is written using Java as its principle language, but the ideas are applicable to any OO language.', '978-02-014-8567-7', 1999, 'Addison-Wesley Professional', 48.33),

By the time you finish this book, youâ€™ll be able to take advantage of the best design practices and experiences of those who have fought the beast of software design and triumphed.\r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s so special about this book?\r\n\r\nWe think your time is too valuable to spend struggling with new concepts.
